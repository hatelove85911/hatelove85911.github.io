tags: [ui5, javascript]

I did some more digging into D3 world, and I found two articles introducing making reusable chart using d3.js:
* [Towards Reusable Charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) written by the author of D3 library Mike Bostock
* [A Framework for Creating Reusable Charts with d3.js](https://bocoup.com/weblog/introducing-d3-chart) published by misoproject to introduce a framework to create reusable d3 chart

After reading, I started thinking what I'm trying to achieve ? What a reusable chart really means ? Finally I came up a conclusion:
1. What I want to achieve in my last project is very simple, I just want to embed a d3 chart into UI5 application
2.
